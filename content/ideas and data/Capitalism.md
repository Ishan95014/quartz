> Capitalism is a form of society where some individuals implement the *capitalization procedure*. It is the action of taking an existing thing, such as a chair, and declaring it a piece of capital, a stock, which will provide itâ€™s private owner with income in the future, from which he will benefit. The value of the chair today is nothing but the discounted value of the flow of income the chair is going to provide him in the future. 

>It has existed since at least the 14th Century, used by Italian Banks in the north of Italy.
